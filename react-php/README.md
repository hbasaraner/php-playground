# React + PHP

This React works as a API that shows your POST request in JSON format.

1. In this query, let's assume that we have blog site and we want to query our post. I select "title" and "body" as property and I send it to localhost:8000/store with Postman.
   

   ![POST](https://github.com/hbasaraner/php-playground/blob/master/react-php/images/post.png)

   

2. When we want to see our post, we only make GET request to our site. 
   

   ![GET](https://github.com/hbasaraner/php-playground/blob/master/react-php/images/get.png)

Also it can be shown directly homepage. (Used JSON Viewer extension)

![WEB](https://github.com/hbasaraner/php-playground/blob/master/react-php/images/web.png)
